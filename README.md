My portfolio
Personal Portfolio – Vintage Desktop Theme

My goal for this project was to design a portfolio website inspired by the look and feel of late ’90s to early 2000s Microsoft desktops. I aimed to capture a nostalgic yet functional aesthetic while showcasing my work and personality as a developer.
This project is still a work in progress. I’m continuing to improve the responsiveness for mobile and tablet devices, and I’m also working on organizing my HTML and CSS more efficiently. My goal is to ensure that if I were collaborating with a team, the codebase would be clean, consistent, and easy to navigate.

If you have any tips, tricks, or suggestions that could make this portfolio smoother, more responsive, or more refined, feel free to drop me a line — I’m always open to learning and improving!
